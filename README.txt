Recipe Hero Labels adds a settings tab to Recipe Hero that allows you to customize the labels used by the plugin.

== Description ==

With this plugin, a new settings tab will appear under the Recipe Hero settings, allowing you to customise the following 'labels':

* Serves
* Equipment
* Prep Time
* Cook Time
* Cuisine
* Course

It's recommended to translate the plugin for finer control over the text output, but I understand that there are many different ways to describe the above labels - so translating doesn't really feel like the best thing to do.
